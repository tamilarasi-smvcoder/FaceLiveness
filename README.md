# Attendees Recorder with Face Spoof Detector 

Face recognition  is one  of the mostly used biometrics.
Face recognition system can  also be used  for attendance  marking in schools, colleges,  offices, etc. 
This  project aims  to build a  class attendance system with face spoof detection. Which uses the method is based on  auxiliary supervision of Fourier spectrum.
Auxiliary supervision to guide the learning toward discriminative and generalizable cues.
CNN model is learned to estimate the face depth with pixel-wise supervision.


In the proposed system using silent face anti-spoofing detection technology.
This concept to judge whether the face in front of the machine is real or fake. 
The face presented by other media can be defined as false face, including printed paper photos, display screen of electronic products, silicone mask, 3D human image, etc.
Cooperative living detection requires the user to complete the specified action according to the prompt, and then carry out the live verification.
while the silent live detection directly performs the live verification.
